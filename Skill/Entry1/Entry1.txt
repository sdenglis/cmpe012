I'm a sucker for hobbies for multiple reasons. Of course,
I could have easily chosen to write an essay (I absolutely love to write,
creative writing in specific). However, I feel that this can be accomplished
over a very brief period of time, not utilizing as much of the determination
or resolve required to master a specific skill. Therefore: I have set upon
learning (or rather continuing to learn) and perfect the art of the piano.
In order to somehow document my own progress, I plan on recording video
evidence of my evolution in ability over the course of these coming weeks,
months. As I have already been practicing the piano for some time now, I will
set a specific goal of learning the following pieces:

Liebestraum No. 3, Liszt
Etude Op. 25 No. 5, Chopin

I plan to practice as much as possible, enlisting the help of both the UCSC
music department's practice rooms as well as my own piano owned at home.
In order to progress, I must focus on learning the notes from the sheet music,
listen to performances of each composition to gain knowledge of phrasing,
dynamics, etc. As previously mentioned, I plan on recording each benchmark
practice session and uploading them directly to YouTube (or some other video
streaming service). As a final note, I also happen to be emotionally-invested
in drone cinematography; over the course of a year, I've managed to teach
myself a plethora of information regarding photography, video editing, and
much more. Below, I will attempt to attach both my progress in piano as well
as with drone stuff!
