It's been difficult, as previously mentioned, to keep up the pace with my skill
progression. Schoolwork has dominated my weekly schedule, and thus has limited the
time available to work on other things: motivation starts to fall apart, etc.
I've managed to keep academics and my hobbies separate in order to not burn myself
out. I still practice for the sake of relaxing and improving in something that I
genuinely enjoy to do. However, I've begun to realize that in order to progress beyond
my current capabilities, I must learn how to conquer my biggest fear: reading sheet music.
I am able to play fairly complicated compositions on the piano, with little to no
knowledge regarding the written score. If I want to continue down my current path,
I must learn the language of the keyboard. It may be hard, it may be frustrating
(because I will be slowing down to a snail's pace in order to correctly read and
identify each note), but it will be worth it in the end. To be able to fluently
read any given piece, sit down and perform with a minimal amount of errors would
be incredible. After all, it's one thing to memorize a book, but an entirely different
process to sit down and take the time to learn how to read. Furthermore, the drone
industry is a bit slow during the winter season. I've been able to continue editing
and learning how to color grade footage in After Effects; things have been going
smoothly there, and I'm still in contact with my real estate agency for more work
to come during the summer.
