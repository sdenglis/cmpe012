First, I've been able to practice quite a bit, but not as much as I originally
intended to. With a full STEM workload, it hasn't been easy to find as much time
to set aside in order to work on my piano pieces, editing, etc. Rather than simply
give in to my other activities, I suggest to create a solid schedule so that,
no matter what, I will at least practice some allotted amount of time on x, y,
and z days during the week. Other than this, things are going smoothly: in fact,
I'm going to attempt to learn Rachmaninov's Love's Sorrow (a favorite of mine) on
top of my current assigned repertoire. Constantly, on my commute to school and back,
I listen to these songs performed by renowned pianists in order to get in touch
with various styles of play and the phrasing of each measure. I truly hope that
I will follow through with this plan of action; mastering these compositions would
be a fantastic accomplishment which would invigorate my heart and inspire me to push
forward in all other branches of life. As for the drone category, I've managed to
teach myself the basics of filming and editing. Linked below is, in my opinion,
a very beautiful short video showcasing Northern California.
