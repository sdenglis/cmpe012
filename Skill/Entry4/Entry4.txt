Wow, this is it: my final entry. I'd like to think that I've come a long way;
however, things did start to slow down as the quarter sped up. I wasn't able to
achieve all that I sought to accomplish. This was no easy feat, I tackled more
than I could chew. Learning from my mistakes and errs, I realize that I should have
stuck to a single composition for piano, etc. This would have made my goal more
clear-cut, allowing myself to hack away at the progression meter, little by little.
I definitely wish to continue working on these skills, but in a more efficient manner,
allowing myself the time and space to devote myself to a given routine.
Honestly, I think I'll also have to add a bullet point to my list of hobbies:
I want to learn how to code cool stuff! After watching videos on HTML, C, java, etc.
I feel inspired to create my own programs and interesting algorithms. This,
if oriented as more of a pastime, would then lessen the negative impact of
programming assignments for school. Anyways, there's a lot to experience in terms
of coding and different paths which one can take. Personally speaking, I believe that
I would be interested in an artistic approach to coding (simulations, HTML, website
and graphics), as well as cryptography type stuff. Anyways, I am satisfied with
where I am currently, and its very reassuring to realize that no matter what, I'll
always have these little hobbies to guide me, to cheer me up, and for me to master
through time and honest dedication. Nobody can take away a skill from me: its
something which I earn, which I carry for the rest of my life.
