LAB 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
CMPE 012 Fall 2018

I've actually learned a lot more than I could have imagined from this single lab.
It was an amazing combination of the physical components of computer engineering,
the need for knowledge in regards to the git terminal, pushing and pulling files
between remote systems. I'm glad to be able to say that I am now aware of Boolean
algebra, logic circuits and different types of logic gates. From my own experience,
I would say that everything went fairly smoothly. In fact, one of the only issues
I found myself having was navigating the program smoothly on my laptop. Once I
was able to transfer files to my desktop, things were a lot better. Other than
that, the general concepts of truth tables aren't that difficult to grasp. However,
it would have been nice if we could have gone over De Morgan's Law in more detail
relating to different and complex examples of logic problems.
