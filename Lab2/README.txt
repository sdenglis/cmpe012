Lab 2: Whack-A-Mole

// What were the learning objectives of this lab?
// From what I have managed to gather, we were to apply the skills as well as
knowledge gained from lecture and then apply them to more practical approaches
or modes of learning via. MML. Specifically speaking, the derivation of logic
circuits based on 4-bit adders, registers, as well as use of 2:1 MUX components
were essential to our success in this lab.

// What was your design approach?
// Taking into account the overarching technology, process and pseudo-logic
behind a simple Whack-A-Mole game, I was able to blueprint an approach which
would take into account the very basics of the requirements, inputs and
subsequent outputs. After acknowledging which components I would need to
implement as well as where I would need to implement them (how they fit
together, interact with one another), things began to fall into place.

// Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
// First and foremost, I encountered only a few issues: starting off the lab,
checking wire connections (more tedious than anything), as well as
troubleshooting the converted signed magnitude display. The former, once I went
through the motions of reading through lecture notes, asking questions, etc. was
easy. The latter just took some time just to figure out why my inputs weren't
executing the correct sequence of events. In the end, the overall experience of
doing this lab was quite informative and (dare I say) fun to tinker with. I
believe that I have come out with significantly more knowledge than I had initially.


// How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
// The lab assignment itself is a bit too vague for my tastes; although, I realize
that hand-holding the students through each step of the assignment is bad. I simply
feel that it would be in the best interest of the students to
guide them in a fitting way, providing the correct resources for them to
learn or research whatever questions they have.
